 <h3>Avengers: Assemble</h3>

 <p>Best Science Fiction Movie For Superheroes Fan</p>

 <p>When darkness falls and villains reign,<br />  
    The heroes rise through fire and pain.<br />  
    With strength united, hear the call,<br />  
    "Avengers Assemble!"—they stand tall.</p>

 <h3>Avengers: Age of Ultron</h3>

 <p>Best Artificial Intelligence Movie in Marvels</p>

 <p>Steel and code, a mind betrayed,<br />  
    Ultron rose, the world afraid.<br />  
    But heroes stood, their bond so tight,<br />  
    To end the war and set things right.</p>

 <h3>Avengers: Infinity War</h3>

 <p>Bestest Movie I ever seen in my life in every Universe</p>

 <p>A battle waged, the stars turned dark,<br />  
    Thanos struck with fate so stark.<br />  
    Half were lost, a price so steep,<br />  
    In silence, heroes mourn and weep.</p>

 <h3>Avengers: Endgame</h3>

 <p>Bestest Movie Climax I ever Seen in my Life </p>

 <p>Heroes rise, their fate untold,<br />
    In Endgame’s fight, both fierce and bold.<br />
    Through time and loss, they stand as one,<br />
    A final snap, the war is won.</p>

 <h3>Thor: Ragnarok</h3>

 <p>Best Thor Movie in Marvels</p>

 <p>A god betrayed, his home in flame,<br />  
    Thor rose strong, yet not the same.<br />  
    With thunder’s might and battle's roar,<br />  
    Ragnarok came—Asgard no more.</p>
